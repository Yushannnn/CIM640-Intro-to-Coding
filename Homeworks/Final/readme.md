[My midterm project]()

The reason why I made this project is to encourage users explore tiny sounds around them. People who live in the fast paced society, they usually ignore the pretty things. People spend a lot of time on the entertainments things, including myself. I want to remind people and myself how the original, natural sound sounds like.

The inputs, I inputed some sources and library into this code, including animals' icons, sound library.

The outputs, there is a cartoon town called Sound Town. User will see an instruction at the first page, and there are two choice for them, Farm and Street.


The target audience are 4 years old and elder. For the kids, it can help them to know this world, and for the elder user, it can help them to recall the original memory and natural world.

This project will displayed as an application, users can download it on their devices. They can use it at any time.
